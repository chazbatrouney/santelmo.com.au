    <p>San Telmo is a new and exciting restaurant and bar, inspired by not only a love of Argentinian food and wine but also their vivacious lifestyle and rich culture.</p>
    <p>Offering a warm and casual option for breakfast, lunch and dinner, San Telmo's follows the Argentinian ethos that eating, drinking and most importantly life are there to be enjoyed.</p>
    <p>The name San Telmo comes from the oldest neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, full of traditional Parrilla restaurants, bars and beautiful Colonial buildings, creating an enchanting backdrop for the eclectic bohemian art and weekend street market. Our logo was designed in Bs As by the top fileteado artist drawing inspiration on the vibrant and lively tango culture which remains a huge influence throughout the city of Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>The restaurants interior is a meeting of old world Argentine Bodega with the flow and open-plan style of intimate Melbourne dinning where the kitchen becomes an integral part of the show and the atmosphere. Appointed with imported cow hides, 300 year old antique doors and historic 1930's coloured glass soda siphon bottles from the suburb of San Telmo from the thirties, the interior tells a storey about the Buenos Aires of old.</p>
    <p>Continuing our endeavor to capture the essence of Argentine culture and cuisine, we have imported a bespoke 2.5 metre parrilla charcoal grill, hand made by Pirincho, a lifelong master of the craft. As one of the most highly regarded parilla craftsman in the world, Pirincho’s previous customers include the likes of former Argentine presidents, the Ferrari workshop in Modena, and the VIP restaurant in the Barcelona FC Stadium.</p>
    <p>San Telmo’s wine list has been sourced from our favourite bodegas, sampled during our time in Argentina. It displays our love of the Argentinians unrivalled use of the otherwise forgotten Malbec grape, as well as their ability to produce great examples of many different varietals.</p>
    <p>Che we look forward to being able to share the food, the wine and our memories of Buenos Aires and Argentina with you!</p>
